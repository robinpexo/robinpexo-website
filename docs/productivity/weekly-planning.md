## Intent

Planning is a way to reduce decision fatigue. I pick a small number of outcomes and protect time for them.

## Weekly outline

```text
Mon: Plan + Deep work
Tue: Build
Wed: Review + Iterate
Thu: Build
Fri: Ship + Reflect
```

## Guardrails

- Keep a short list (3 priorities max).
- Leave buffer time for surprises.

## Notes

This is a starter plan and will evolve.
