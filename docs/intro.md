# Intro

Welcome to my notes.

These docs are meant to be read in order or jumped into as you like. Each note captures my thought process, the decisions I made, and the context behind them. You'll find technical notes, as well as non-technical lessons I picked up along the way.

If you're reading this, feel free to start at the beginning, skim the sections that matter to you, and come back later as things evolve.
