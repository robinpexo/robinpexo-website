## Why identity matters

I build habits faster when I connect them to a clear identity. The habit becomes an expression of who I am, not just a task.

## Habit loop snapshot

Cue → Craving → Response → Reward
```

## Small experiment

- Choose one habit for the week.
- Make the cue obvious and the response tiny.
- Track the streak for 7 days.

## Notes

I will expand this with specific routines and adjustments over time.
