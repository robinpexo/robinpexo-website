## Weekly review

I use short weekly reviews to notice patterns before they become problems.

## Questions I ask

- What gave me energy?
- What drained me?
- What should I stop, start, or continue?

## Simple template

```markdown
### Wins
- 

### Friction
- 

### Next Week
- 
```

## Next steps

I will add examples as I collect more entries.
